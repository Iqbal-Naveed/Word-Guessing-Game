# Word-Guessing-Game
🔠 Word Predictor using Transposed Grid (C++)
This C++ program is a fun word-guessing trick that uses matrix transposition to determine a word the user is thinking of. It demonstrates basic 2D array manipulation, input/output handling, and a clever use of user interactions to extract data step-by-step.

📌 How It Works
The program displays a 6x5 alphabet grid.

The user is asked to:

Think of a word.

Enter the number of alphabets in that word.

Provide the column number of each letter (where that letter appears in the grid).

The program then displays the selected columns, transposed.

The user re-identifies the column number of each letter in the transposed view.

Based on this, the program reconstructs and prints the original word.

📘 Concepts Used
2D Array manipulation

Matrix transposition

Input/output handling
